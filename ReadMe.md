# 4. Conclusion

1. We could see that gradient boosting algorithm performance  in the cross-validation data was better than the other machine learning models used. Deep Neural Networks also performed well but gradient boosting tree was the best machine learning model for predicting the bike demand.
2. Scatterplots were used for the predictions and the actual test values to get the output respectively. 
3. Values were converted so that they lie between 0 and 1 respectively. 
4. Exploratory data analysis gives a good understanding of different features and how they influence the outcomes for different datasets and distributions.
